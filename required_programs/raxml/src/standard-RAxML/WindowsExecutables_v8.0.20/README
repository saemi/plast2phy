Windows executables kindly compiled by Ingo Michalak (using a MinGW cross compiler in 
Cygwin). This is for RAxML version 8.0.14

The .dll file contained in the zip folder is necessary to run the PTHREADS 
version, so put it into the same folder as the RAxML windows executabke. 

Ingo took the dll from the cygwin package so we assume it is GPL and thus ok to distribute.
